# 🖼️ Flask + MinIO + Thumbor Image Gallery

A small web application built with **Flask**, using **MinIO** for image storage and **Thumbor** for image resizing and transformation.  
The app allows users to upload images, view them as thumbnails, and open full-size versions in a Bootstrap modal viewer.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Upload new images via `/upload`
- 🗂️ Store files in **MinIO** bucket (`img`)
- 🔍 Display thumbnails generated by **Thumbor**
- 🖼️ Open full-size images in a Bootstrap modal
- 💅 Styled with **Bootstrap 5** + custom `style.css`

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Flask**
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible storage)
- **Thumbor** (image transformation)
- **Docker Compose** (to run MinIO and Thumbor)
- **Bootstrap 5** for layout and responsive design (grid, buttons, modal components)
- Custom **style.css** to define the dark theme and visual effects :D
